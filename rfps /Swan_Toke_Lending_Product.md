# Request for Proposals (RFP): Swan Token Lending Product

## Overview

We are excited to announce a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development of the **Swan Token Lending Product**. This initiative seeks to empower computing providers by enabling access to collateral for their businesses while offering Swan Token holders opportunities to lend tokens and earn rewards. This project aims to create a user-friendly, efficient, and secure decentralized lending platform.

A sponsorship fund of **$50,000 in Swan Tokens** has been allocated to support this initiative.

## Project Description

### Objective:

Develop a decentralized lending product that:

- Enables computing providers to borrow Swan Tokens as collateral for computing operations.
- Allows Swan Token holders to lend tokens, earn rewards, and maintain liquidity.
- Includes features such as liquid staked tokens for enhanced utility in DeFi applications.
- Incorporates mechanisms for secure borrowing, lending, and staking with transparent fund management.

### Detailed Requirements:

1. **Core Features**:
    - **Borrowing**:
        - Allow computing providers to borrow Swan Tokens with proper collateral mechanisms.
        - Implement systems to track and validate loan usage for computing purposes.
    - **Lending and Staking**:
        - Enable token holders to lend Swan Tokens and earn interest or staking rewards.
        - Offer a liquid staked token (e.g., pSwan) that represents staked tokens, allowing holders to utilize them in DeFi protocols.
    - **Unstaking**:
        - Provide mechanisms for lenders to unstake tokens, with immediate or deferred withdrawals depending on liquidity in the lending pool.

2. **Transparency and Security**:
    - Build an on-chain verification mechanism for borrowing, lending, and staking activities.
    - Use secure smart contracts to minimize risks of exploitation and ensure reliability.

3. **User Experience**:
    - Design an intuitive interface for both computing providers and token holders.
    - Include clear guidance for staking, borrowing, and unstaking processes.

4. **Integration**:
    - Ensure compatibility with the SwanChain ecosystem and its existing infrastructure.
    - Provide APIs for interoperability with other DeFi applications.

5. **Sponsorship Utilization**:
    - Incorporate the $50,000 Swan Token sponsorship to incentivize early adoption and provide rewards to participants.

6. **Inspired Features**:
    - Consider features from the [**Parasail Fluence Staking model**](https://docs.parasail.network/delegation-guides/guide-for-fluence-stakers/staking-flt) , such as liquid staking tokens, easy withdrawal processes, and automated management of rewards.
